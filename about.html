      <h2>Timelapse vs. Hyperlapse: A Comparison</h2>

      <p><strong>Timelapse</strong> and <strong>hyperlapse</strong> are creative photography and videography techniques that capture motion and the passage of time in a visually compelling way. Though similar in concept, they differ in execution and effect.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>What is a Timelapse?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>timelapse</strong> is a sequence of photos taken at regular intervals over a period of time and then played back at a faster speed. This creates the illusion that time is moving quickly — perfect for showing slow processes like sunsets, cloud movements, or city traffic.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>How it works:</strong> A camera remains mostly stationary and takes one photo every few seconds or minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>Example uses:</strong> Watching a flower bloom, capturing stars moving across the sky, or showing crowds forming over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> DSLR or mirrorless cameras, tripods, intervalometers (or built-in interval settings).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What is a Hyperlapse?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>hyperlapse</strong> is essentially a timelapse with significant camera movement. Instead of staying in one spot, the camera is moved — often several feet between shots — to create dynamic motion through a space.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The camera is moved slightly between each frame, usually along a set path (like walking forward down a street).</li>
          <li><strong>Effect:</strong> A smooth, flowing motion through an environment with the time-compression effect of a timelapse.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Requires precise planning and stabilization (either in editing or using tools like gimbals or software).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creative Uses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Filmmakers</strong> use hyperlapses to transition between scenes or showcase travel.</li>
          <li><strong>YouTubers</strong> and <strong>content creators</strong> use timelapses to summarize long processes.</li>
          <li><strong>Photographers</strong> use both to explore light, motion, and environment in new ways.</li>
