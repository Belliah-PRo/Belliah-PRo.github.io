    <p id="description">Time-lapse photography is a technique in which the frequency at which film frames
     are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than the frequency used to view the sequence. When played at normal speed, time appears
     to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured at 1 frame per second but then played back at 30 frames per second;
      the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase. Similarly, film can also be played at a much lower rate than at which it was captured, which slows down an otherwise
       fast action, as in slow motion or high-speed photography.</p>

    <p id="gaming">A common misconception about gamers from non gamers is that all of them are complete nerds, with no athletic skill,
         social life, or love life. This statement is untrue, and in fact, most gamer do more social activities in a day than most other people.</p>

        <p id="greenpi">Raspberry Pi removes the high entry cost to computing for people across all demographics:
            while children can benefit from a computing education that previously wasnâ€™t open to them,
            many adults have also historically been priced out of using computers for enterprise, entertainment
             and creativity. Raspberry Pi eliminates those barriers.</p>
