<p id="description">Time-lapse photography is a technique in which the frequency at which film frames
     are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than the frequency used to view the sequence. When played at normal speed, time appears
      to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured at 1 frame per second but then played back at 30 frames per second;
       the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase. Similarly, film can also be played at a much lower rate than at which it was captured, which slows down an otherwise
        fast action, as in slow motion or high-speed photography.</p>
